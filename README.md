# 🔍 DecentraSearch — Blockchain-Powered Search Engine

**DecentraSearch** is a decentralized, transparent, and censorship-resistant search engine that leverages **blockchain technology** to redefine how information is discovered and indexed on the web.

Unlike traditional centralized platforms like Google, which store and control data in proprietary data centers, **DecentraSearch** empowers users by distributing indexing and retrieval through a blockchain network.

## 💡 Key Concept

> "What if search was not controlled by a single entity?"

DecentraSearch introduces a **trustless** and **transparent** model for web search — ensuring privacy, neutrality, and freedom of information.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🔗 **Decentralized Indexing** – Search index is stored and updated across a blockchain network.
- 🔐 **User Privacy** – No user tracking or profiling.
- 📜 **Immutable Logs** – All queries and indexing events are transparently logged.
- 🗳️ **Community Governance** – Ranking and moderation handled via smart contract-based voting.
- 🛡️ **Censorship Resistance** – No central authority can remove or reorder results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Hyperledger / (customizable based on your implementation)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (for indexing and governance)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python
- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Storage (optional):** IPFS or other distributed storage layer for hosting metadata

## 📌 Why Decentralized?

| Centralized Search (e.g., Google) | DecentraSearch |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Data owned by corporations       | Data owned by the public |
| Biased ranking algorithms        | Community-governed ranking |
| Private data harvesting          | User-anonymous querying |
| Censorship and takedowns         | Tamper-proof content discovery |

## 📈 Future Roadmap

- ✅ MVP with basic keyword search and smart contract integration
- 🔍 Improve indexing with off-chain crawlers + on-chain validation
- 📡 Integrate IPFS for hosting content and metadata
- 🗳️ Launch DAO for result ranking & abuse reporting

## 🧠 Inspiration

The growing concern around **data monopolies**, **algorithmic bias**, and **information censorship** led to the idea of a blockchain-native search engine that promotes **transparency** and **freedom of knowledge**.
